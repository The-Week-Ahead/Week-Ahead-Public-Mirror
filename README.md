# The Week Ahead

The 'Week Ahead' is a simple website that displays the timetable of the school.
It is designed to be simple and as easy to use as possible.
The timetable is stored in a JSON file, and it uses service workers to cache the timetable for offline use, and to also acheive PWA abilities (Progressive Web Apps).

# PUBLIC TODO

- [ ] Better dark mode icon
- [ ] Clean up this codebase (its really bad)
