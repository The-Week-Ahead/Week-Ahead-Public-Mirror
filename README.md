# The Week Ahead

Let me describe the design charachteristics of the website.

The 'Week Ahead' is a simple website that displays the timetable of the school.
It is designed to as easy to use as possible.
The timetable is stored in a JSON file, and it uses service workers to cache the timetable for offline use.

It is also able to acheive PWA abilities (Progressive Web Apps) which allows it to work like a regular app on your phone or computer even!
